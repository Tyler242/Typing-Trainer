# Overview

This repository contains a typing game, The Fastest Fingers in the West, designed to help K-12 kids build their typing skills. The program was created in an effort to learn how to collaborate while creating educational software. While implementing, we learned how to use Pygame to display graphics across multiple screens while handling user inputs and moving objects. As we developed together, we learned how to join the features we created individually and handle a large project through version control. 
Most importantly, we learned how to collaborate effectively while creating meaningful software that will better the world in a small way. 

The object of The Fastest Fingers in the West is to get the highest words per minute possible within a minute. The program opens to a start screen where the user can pick between the two modes, single words and poetry lines. In the single words mode, words move across the screen, and as the user types the letter correctly, they change from black to red. If the word was typed correctly as the enter key is pressed, the word disappears, and words per minute are calculated. The poetry lines mode works similarly, but the user has to type an entire line of poetry correctly instead of a word. After 60 seconds, the user's score and words per minute for the session are displayed on the end screen with buttons either play again or quit.

# Future Work
